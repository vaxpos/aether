description: Basic configuration and first steps with aetherwm.
---

Now that you have aetherwm installed, let's get your environment set up.

## Initial Setup

1. **Create Configuration Directory**

   aetherwm looks for configuration files in `~/.config/aether/`.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/aether
   ```

2. **Copy Default Config**

   A default configuration file is provided at `/etc/aether/config.conf`. Copy it to your local directory to start customizing.

   ```bash
   cp /etc/aether/config.conf ~/.config/aether/config.conf
   ```

3. **Launch aetherwm**

   You can now start the compositor from your TTY.

   ```bash
   aether
   ```

   Optional: To specify a custom config file path:

   ```bash
   aether -c /path/to/your/config.conf
   ```

## Essential Keybindings

aetherwm uses the following keybinds by default:

| Key Combination | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Alt` + `Return` | Open Terminal (defaults to `foot`) |
| `Alt` + `Space` | Open Launcher (defaults to `rofi`) |
| `Alt` + `Q` | Close (Kill) the active window |
| `Super` + `M` | Quit aetherwm |
| `Super` + `F` | Toggle Fullscreen |
| `Alt` + `Arrow Keys` | Move focus (Left, Right, Up, Down) |
| `Ctrl` + `1-9` | Switch to Tag 1-9 |
| `Alt` + `1-9` | Move window to Tag 1-9 |

> **Warning:** Some default bindings rely on specific tools like `foot` (terminal) and `rofi` (launcher). Ensure you have them installed or update your `config.conf` to use your preferred alternatives.
